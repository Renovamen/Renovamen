I'm ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ trying to find a balance between research and engineering. I do machine learning by day and build things for the web by night.

- 🔭 Research-wise, I'm interested in machine learning (enhancing generalizability, efficiency, robustness, etc.) and computer vision (large multimodal models, generative models, etc.).
- 🚀 I'm learning to build machine learning softwares and systems.
- 🧐 I'm also exploring tools like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/).
- 👩‍💻 My personal website is [zxh.me](https://zxh.me), built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). It's simple and serious, much like those of other researchers.
- 🕹️ However, if you wish to see some "interesting" versions, here are my [portfolio](https://portfolio.zxh.me), [dashboard](https://dashboard.zxh.me), and [interactive resume](https://resume.zxh.io).
- 👾 Currently interested in building things in *Minecraft*.
- 🌭 My dream: `while(sleeping){money++;}`

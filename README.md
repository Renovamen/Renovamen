I'm ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

- 🔭 Research-wise, I'm mainly working on topics related to exploring the capability of machines to be continual and efficient, like continual learning, meta-learning and few-shot learning.
- 🚀 I'm learning to build machine learning softwares and systems.
- 🧐 I'm also learning TypeScript, React, Electron and Go.
- 👾 I'm currently interested in constructing buildings in Minecraft.
- 🌭 My dream: `while(sleeping){money++;}`
